1. Make sure your PR has a valid title and description. 
2. Your PR updates only touch the parts of the repo it needs to. In most cases this will be `app/partials/book.md`.

If updating an opinion or recommendation in the book, please help us by providing data to back the change. This helps equip us with tools to make the best call on such updates.

##### Translations

If interested in translating this book, please file an issue and we can chat. Translations may be something we can cater for
as part of the existing repo or something better handled as a fork. By coordinating with us, we'll have the best chance to
serve readers in a way that keeps all versions of the book as synchronized as possible.

## Pagination

The content in this book is being ported over to [Web Fundamentals](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/). We'll be turning it into a new 
chapter on automating image optimization, splitting the content here into different pages. 
In the mean time, we're going to keep Essential Image Optimization a one-page format.
